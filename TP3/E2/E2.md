(File: guestbook2.php, guestbookleavemessage2.php). This application uses a standard php function for sanitization, however the following attacker code can be executed:
```
    this is a nice message");alert("this is attacker code");console.log("
```
Try the attack and explain why it works in spite of sanitization. How do you correct this vulnerability?

One OWASP Rule is don't write with document.write untrusted data.

Here we are writing untrusted text in <script>

This very dangerous because we are sanizing code HTML but we are executing directly JS because we are writing in the script.

We should suppress this script and this document.write and build the web in the server with directly echo.
```
<?php echo htmlspecialchars($messages,ENT_NOQUOTES) ?>
