(File: guestbook.php, guestbookleavemessage.php. You must create file message.txt.)

Use the application: to which kind of vulnerability suffers the application? Demonstrate with an attack that disables the input element of the guestbook.

If we use version 1, we can see that we can execute script JS when we insert code JS with <script> tags. For example, we can insert:
```
<script>document.cookie</script>
```
So when the php engine build the stored message, we can see in a message the client's cookies.

Mention 2 ways in which this attack could be prevented and implement them in 2 versions of guestbook: guestbookA.php and guestbookB.php.
